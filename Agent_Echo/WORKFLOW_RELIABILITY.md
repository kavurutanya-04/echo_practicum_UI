# Workflow reliability: points 3–9

The five roles and final GW Azure default are retained. All manager-facing output is
English. This change does not add a UI, authentication system, bilingual testing or a
comparative provider benchmark.

## 3. Validated recurring metrics and exploratory SQL

Cherry has `run_metric(metric, dimension)` alongside `describe_schema` and `execute_sql`.
When Original selects a catalog metric for the numeric part, the application executes it
before Cherry interprets the result, without an exploratory tool loop. New calculations
retain generated SQL; a calculation repair can leave the prepared route when necessary.
The catalog runs read-only SQL on the physically scoped in-memory copy:

| Metric | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| `cross_team_contributions` | Distinct cross-team Contribution_ID; separate counts with/without manager recognition, with partner feedback, and without any feedback. `dimension=null`. |
| `survey_trend` | Recorded team/date aggregates for one exact dimension, preserving response denominators. |

Distinct IDs and EXISTS prevent feedback joins from multiplying contributions. Dimensions
use bound parameters. Empty populations return zero counts. Feedback is restricted to the
selected interaction period; missing notes do not prove absent recognition or unfairness.
`survey_trend` version 2 matches complete dimension names without case sensitivity and
strips surrounding input whitespace; it does not use fuzzy matching. Empty survey results
mean no matching publishable rows, not zero scores or proof of a backend error. Prepared
metric rows and citation IDs are included in Cherry's model history before interpretation.
Original validates a planned survey dimension against the authorized copy's schema metadata
and requests a corrected plan for an unknown topic such as `quarter` before executing it.
Metric artifacts include version, definition, arguments, SQL and parameters. ZeroSugar
replays both SQL and metric definition. Custom SQL remains available. A conservative guard
rejects the known contribution/feedback JOIN + COUNT(*) mistake; it does not prove the
semantics of every generated query.

## 4. Bounded closure and reuse

The final turn has no tools and asks for an evidence-based answer or explicit limitation.
Each turn states the remaining allowance. Identical tool requests reuse their result within
that run and trigger closure. Global call/tool/time limits still apply. A failed or
noncompliant model produces an explicit failure instead of invented conclusions.

## 5. Selective roles

Original submits a typed plan: numeric evidence, text evidence, optional chart or a
necessary task clarification. Only planned specialists are available. Simple counts can
skip Vanilla and Lime. Analytical findings still require ZeroSugar review. Clarification
responses contain no analytical findings.

## 6. Localized repairs

ZeroSugar selects repair targets: Cherry, Vanilla, Lime, Original or clarification. The
single correction pass permits only affected specialists. Chart-only repairs reuse the
candidate and calculations. Unchanged chart plans are reused when another role is repaired.
Sources and the final package are still reviewed. Nothing is cached across executions.

## 7. Review by finding

Each substantive paragraph/block, including uncited blocks, receives an independent
review with its original ID and citation IDs. When evidence is available, uncited blocks
are withheld until explicitly grounded. Plain headings and standalone Markdown separators
(`---`, `***`, `___`) are excluded. Blocks containing substantive text remain reviewable,
including uncited claims. All claims in a block must be supported; one unsupported claim withholds that block.
The reviewer cannot rewrite the text into a new claim. Missing/repeated findings or changed
source IDs invalidate the review. Source checks also run per block. A safety failure or
deterministic package error prevents partial release. English is the application policy.

`supported` means the finding passed implemented source checks and independent model
review, not human validation or measured semantic accuracy. Units are text blocks, not a
guaranteed atomic-claim parser. Legacy four-field reviews are allowed only in offline
fixtures; live reviews require finding coverage and repair targets.

## 8. Informative outcomes

| Original status | Released content | Exit |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `complete` | Accepted answer and findings | 0 |
| `partial` | Independently supported blocks plus unresolved work | 2 |
| `needs_clarification` | Necessary task question; eligible reviewed blocks only | 2 |
| `failed` | Explanation and next step; no unverified conclusions | 1 |

Artifacts include `findings`, `limitations`, `next_steps`, `clarification_questions` and
safe `failure` metadata. Rejected drafts and withheld blocks stay local for diagnostics;
a future UI must not render them as approved findings. Direct specialist results remain
`unverified` until reviewed. Incomplete survey classification still produces no partial
sentiment percentages. Charts are withheld for incomplete packages. Known failures also
write an explicitly failed artifact when `--output` is supplied; successful artifacts are
saved before printing. Cancellation remains exit 130 with an incremental execution log.

## 9. Diagnostics

Automatic local JSONL logs include plan choices, skipped roles, remaining budgets,
closure, request fingerprints, cache hits, metric execution/replay, finding decisions,
repair targets and final response status. They exclude raw queries, prompts, answers,
employee records, credentials and provider payloads. Optional local artifacts retain the
detailed evidence and `diagnostics.last_unverified_text` after a formatting failure; this
diagnostic text is never a released finding. Known citation wrappers are normalized without
creating new source records. Provider null sentinels are handled as absent values, not questions. All reports/logs remain ignored by Git.

Behavioral tests cover duplicates, parameter binding, closure, reuse, role selection,
localized correction, finding coverage and safe partial release. These implementation
checks do not replace the deferred comparative live evaluation.
